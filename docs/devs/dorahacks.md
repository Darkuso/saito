# DoraHacks SF Hackathon

We're happy to be part of the DoraHacks SF Hackathon happening on Dec 11th. We're offering prizes to the top 3 teams who complete all of the challenges listed below. We also have a couple of examples to get you started.

## Saito Application Examples:

Below are a couple of examples the Saito team thinks will make a great addition to the current network. These are the sorts of applications we’re anticipating to see come from enterprising teams taking on our challenges at the DoraHacks hackathon — feel free to try and execute the below examples, but teams are encouraged to pursue their own ideas, too.

_**EXAMPLE ONE:**_ Saito Blackjack — implement a version of on-chain blackjack that uses Saito tokens for the game mechanics of this popular card game.

_**EXAMPLE TWO:**_ “Proof-of-Human” Advertising — create a module that rewards tokens to users viewing advertisements on the Saito network, but that can’t be cheated by bots.


## Challenge One — Blockchain Application
Difficulty Level — Easy
Language — JavaScript

Description: Create a blockchain application on Saito.
- Stand-alone user interface
- Custom logic that listens on-chain for updates
- Display and respond to on-chain information

...


## Challenge Two — Email Application
Difficulty Level — Medium
Language — JavaScript

Description: Build an application on Saito that integrates with the email module. 
- Create custom message UI and payload
- Post custom messages to chain
- Extend the functionality of the application in a meaningful way

...

## Challenge Three — Advertising Integration
Difficulty Level — Hard
Language — JavaScript

Description: Integrate advertising into your application to reward users who visit
- Integrate the advertising module to run on your front end
- Display the users tokens somewhere in the UI of your application
- We should see an increase of the users tokens if completed successfully


## Judging Criteria: 
What percentage of Silicon Valley/IT industry is being put out of business?
How effectively does it integrate with other Saito modules?
How does the usability of the module compare to a centralized alternative?

_**Saito Modules to Integrate:**_
- Email
- Advertising
- Encryption
- DNS

_**Bounties:**_
Using the above criteria, we will be providing the top three hackers/teams that complete all three Saito challenges with an ETH bounty (based on the following distribution):

_**First place:**_ 6 ETH
_**Second place:**_ 3 ETH
_**Third place:**_ 1.5 ETH

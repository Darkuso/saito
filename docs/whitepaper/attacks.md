# Attacks

Saito is secure against classes of attack. This document explains those defense mechanisms.

## 1. SYBIL ATTACKS

Saito is secure against sybil attacks.

It is possible to identify sybils in Saito by examining the transaction-embedded routing paths. This ability to recognize sybils (who occupy intermediate positions in the routing network and consume more in value than they contribute to their peers) and makes Saito distinct from other blockchains, which lack the ability to identify which nodes in their routing network are providing real value.

As every hop in a routing path lowers the profitability of every single node on that path, there is a strong incentive for all nodes to purge sybils from their routing paths. This is particularly the case for nodes on the inside of a sybil which experience an immediate fifty-percent drop in profitability. Nodes which fail to monitor local routing conditions and get sybilled will be less profitable than their peers, unable to compete effectively, and forced off the network through organic economic competition.

Nodes may easily route around sybils by connecting to their remote peers. The blockchain may be used to communicate with remote peers as necessary. We expect that most nodes will automate this process. 



## 2. TRANSACTION HOARDING

Other blockchains are vulnerable to transaction hoarding attacks. Block producers who pay to collect transactions are strictly disincentivized from sharing those transactions with their peers lest those peers "free-ride" on their work and gain market share at their expanse. This problem incentives hoarding once the network is too large for a volunteer-supported peer-to-peer network to distribute transactions to miners. It breaks the economics of those blockchains: users looking for fast confirmations in networks with hoarding will direct their transactions to the largest and more profitable block producers. Centralization inexorably follows.

Saito is secure against transaction hoarding attack.

The network achieves this by paying the nodes which collect transactions from users the largest share of the routing payments. This encourages competition to form at user-facing portions of the network and ensures there will always be nodes willing to offer routing services to users. The profitability of these competing routing nodes consequently depends on their forwarding these transactions as quickly and efficiently as possible to block producers. 

Any nodes which "hoard" transactions which may be held by others risk losing the value of their routing work completely. But they may earn revenue from routing work even if they are not able to produce a block: forwarding is a preferred strategy. The transaction-embedded routing paths also allows users and nodes to monitor the behavior of their peers and negotiate reasonable terms of service given local economic conditions.
